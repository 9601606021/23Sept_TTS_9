    <h2>Q.82 What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h2>
    <fieldset>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The use of innerHTML very slow:</strong> The process of using innerHTML is much
            slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are
            also re-parsed which takes time.</li>
        <li><strong>Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements:</strong> The event
            handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting innerHTML
            automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new
            elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.</li>
        <li><strong>Content is replaced everywhere:</strong> Either you add, append, delete or
            modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM
            nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.</li>
        <li><strong>Appending to innerHTML is not supported:</strong> Usually, += is used for
            appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag
            is re-parsed.
            <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
            <pre>                            &lt;p id="geek"&gt;Geeks&lt;/p&gt;
        title = document.getElementById('#geek')
        
        // The whole "geek" tag is reparsed
        title.innerHTML += '&lt;p&gt; forGeeks &lt;/p&gt;'</pre>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Old content replaced issue:</strong> The old content is replaced even if
            object.innerHTML = object.innerHTML + ‘html’ is used instead of object.innerHTML +=
            ‘html’. There is no way of appending without reparsing the whole innerHTML. Therefore,
            working with innerHTML becomes very slow. String concatenation just does not scale when
            dynamic DOM elements need to be created as the plus’ and quote openings and closings
            becomes difficult to track.</li>
        <li><strong>Can break the document:</strong> There is no proper validation provided by
            innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used. This may break the document of
            JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS):</strong> The fact that innerHTML
            can add text and elements to the webpage, can easily be used by malicious users to
            manipulate and display undesirable or harmful elements within other HTML element tags.
            Cross-site Scripting may also lead to loss, leak and change of sensitive information.
