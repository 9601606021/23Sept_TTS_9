    <h2>Q.68 What is negative Infinity?</h2>
    <fieldset>
        <pre>
    <p>The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value
        that is the lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It
        can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.</p>

    <p>Negative infinity is different from mathematical infinity in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by any other number.
        </li>
        <li>When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN</li>
        <li>Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number (apart from positive infinity) is
            negative infinity.</li>
        <li>Negative infinity, divided by any negative number (apart from negative infinity) is
            positive infinity.</li>
        <li>If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.</li>
        <li>The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.</li>
        <li>The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.</li>
        <li>The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.</li>
    </ul>
