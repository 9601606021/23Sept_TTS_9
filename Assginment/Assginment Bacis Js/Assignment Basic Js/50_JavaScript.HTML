    <h2>Q.50 What is the drawback of declaring methods
        directly in JavaScript objects?</h2>
    <p>One drawback of declaring methods directly in JavaScript objects is that it leads to code
        duplication if the method is intended to be shared among multiple instances of the object.
        When you define a method directly within an object, each instance of that object gets its
        own
        copy of the method. This can result in increased memory consumption and can be less
        efficient
        than if the method were shared among all instances through the prototype chain.</p>
