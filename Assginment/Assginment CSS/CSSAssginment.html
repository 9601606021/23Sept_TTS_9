        <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.</li>
        <li>The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>

        <li>CSS3 introduces several properties attended with new values and units. It facilitates styling of backgrounds, borders, boxes, etcâ€¦, that permits the USA to stay most of the styling at intervals the computer network and HTML standards and our document, while not a necessity for all those proprietary third-party package packages.</li>
        <li>New values and new units square measure introduced to support all those new properties. for example, Angle units deg, grad, rad, and switch or Time units s and ms.</li>
