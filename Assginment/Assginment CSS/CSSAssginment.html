    <h1>CSS Assginment</h1>
    <h2>Module 4-CSS and CSS 3</h2>
    <h3>01.What are the benefits of using CSS?</H3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.</li>
        <li>The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li>
        <li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.</li>
        <li>It is less complex therefore the effort are significantly reduced.</li>
        <li>It helps to form spontaneous and consistent changes.</li>
        <li>It has the power for re-positioning. It helps us to determine the changes within the position of web elements who are there on the page.</li>
        <li>These bandwidth savings are substantial figures of insignificant tags that are indistinct from a mess of pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>02.What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.</li>
        <li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li>
        <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li>
        <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.</li>
        <li>The programming language world is complicated for non-developers and beginners. Different levels of CSS i.e. CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3 are often quite confusing.</li>
        <li>Browser compatibility (some styles sheet are supported and some are not).</li>
        <li>CSS works differently on different browsers. IE and Opera supports CSS as different logic.</li>
        <li>There might be cross-browser issues while using CSS.</li>
        <li>There are multiple levels which creates confusion for non-developers and beginners.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>03.What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS3 is split into many various documents known as Modules. each module adds new capability or extends options outlined in CSS2 over conserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS3 started around the time of publication of the initial CSS2 recommendation.</li>
        <li>The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.</li>
        <li>CSS3 introduces several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an exceeding type of pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.</li>
        <li>The new addition of General relation Combinator will be wont to match relation parts of a given part through diacritic (~) combinator.</li>
        <li>CSS3 introduces several properties attended with new values and units. It facilitates styling of backgrounds, borders, boxes, etc…, that permits the USA to stay most of the styling at intervals the computer network and HTML standards and our document, while not a necessity for all those proprietary third-party package packages.</li>
        <li>New values and new units square measure introduced to support all those new properties. for example, Angle units deg, grad, rad, and switch or Time units s and ms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>04.Name a few CSS style components.</h3>
    <h3>05.What do you understand by CSS opacity?</h3>
    <p>The opacity property sets the opacity level for an element.</p>
    <p>The opacity-level describes the transparency-level, where 1 is not transparent and 2 is 50% transparent see-through.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
        <img class="filter-opacity1" src="img_forest.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="col">
        <img class="filter-opacity2" src="img_forest.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>06.How can the background color of an element be changed?</h3>
    <div style="background-color: aqua;">
    <p>The background-color property sets the background color of an element.</p>
    <p>The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).</p>
    </div>
    <h3>07.How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h3>
    <p>In this article, we will see how an image repetition of the backup is controlled in CSS. This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of the image.</p>
    <p>The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background image will be repeated or not.</p>
    <p>Syntax: background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;</p>
    <h3>08.What is the use of the background-position property?</h3>
    <p>The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.</p>
    <h3>09.Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h3>
    <p>The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.</p>
    <h3>10.Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h3>
    <h3>11.How to center block elements using CSS1?</h3>
    <p>The “blocks” are known for taking full line space, forcing other elements to start on a new line. In other words, they have a width of 100% of the webpage or container holding the block.  In this article, we are going to see how to block elements that usually behave and how to center them using CSS.</p>
    <h3>12.How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h3>
    <h3>13.What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?</h3>
    <h3>14.What is embedded style sheets?</h3>
    <p>It allows you to define styles for a particular HTML document as a whole in one place. This is done by embedding the &lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt; tags containing the CSS properties in the head of your document. Embedded style sheets are particularly useful for HTML documents that have unique style requirements from the rest of the documents in your project. However, if the styles need to be applied across multiple documents, you should link to an external style sheet instead of using individual embedded style sheets. Using embedded stylesheets holds a distinct advantage over inline styles which only allow you to address one HTML element at a time.</p>
    <h3>15.What are the external style sheets?</h3>
    <p>An external style sheet is a separate file where you can declare all the styles that you want to use on your website. You then link to the external style sheet from all your HTML pages.</p>
    <p>This means you only need to set the styles for each element once. If you want to update the style of your website, you only need to do it in one place.</p>
    <h3>16.What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h3>
    <style>
        .post-full-content h4 {
            /* font-size: 2.8rem; */
            /* color: black; */
            font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
            /* margin: 0.5em; */
        }
    </style>
    <h4 id="prosofexternalstylesheets">Pros of External Stylesheets</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Makes styles reusable across multiple HTML files.</li>
        <li>It is easier to maintain.</li>
        <li>It is cached by the browser on initial load, making page rendering easier and less time consuming after subsequent page loads.</li>
        <li>It can be hosted on a CDN, so bandwidth becomes minimal and it can be easily transported across various regions of the world.</li>
    </ul>
