        The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus) is among the most spectacular and variable of the group, 
        with 21 races scattered over the southwestern Pacific.
        Most races of this 150-gram (5-ounce) species have red bills, blue heads, green wings, and black feet, 
        though the colour and pattern of the chest, neck, and belly vary dramatically. 
        Screeching, chattering flocks feed in the upper canopy and nest in hollow trees, sometimes in the company of flocks of other fruit- and nectar-eating species. 
        At night they gather, sometimes by the thousands, in communal roosts.

        The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) is a species of parrot found in Australia. 
        It is common along the eastern seaboard, from northern Queensland to South Australia. 
        Its habitat is rainforest, coastal bush and woodland areas. 
        Six taxa traditionally listed as subspecies of the rainbow lorikeet are now treated as separate species.
